    "### Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to LLMs (prompts) that effectively communicate the task at hand to the LLM, leading it to return accurate and useful outputs (Figure 3.1). Prompt engineering is a skill that requires an understanding of the nuances of language, the specific domain being worked on, and the capabilities and limitations of the LLM being used."

    "### Fine-tuning hinges on the idea of transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique that leverages pre-trained models to build upon existing knowledge for new tasks or domains. In the case of LLMs, this involves utilizing the pre-training to transfer general language understanding, including grammar and general knowledge, to particular domain-specific tasks. However, the pre-training may not be sufficient to understand the nuances of certain closed or specialized topics, such as a companyâ€™s legal structure or guidelines.\n",
